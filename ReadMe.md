# Automated Customer Support System

## Overview
This project is an automated customer support system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to handle and respond to customer inquiries in real-time. The system is designed to understand customer queries, provide relevant information, and escalate issues to human agents when necessary.

## Features
- NLP model to understand and process customer queries
- Machine learning classification to route inquiries
- RESTful API for query submission and response
- User-friendly interface for customer interaction
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Seamless escalation to human agents for complex issues

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** Flask, NLTK, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, joblib
- **Database:** (Optional) PostgreSQL/MySQL, MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-support-system.git
   cd customer-support-system
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download necessary NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

4. Prepare the data:
   - Place your `customer_support_data.csv` file in the project directory.
   - Run the data preprocessing script:
     ```bash
     python data_preprocessing.py
     ```

5. Train the NLP model:
   ```bash
   python nlp_model.py
   ```

6. Start the Flask API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Testing the API

You can test the API using `curl` or any API testing tool like Postman.

#### Using PowerShell
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"query": "How can I reset my password?"}'
```

#### Using Command Prompt
```cmd
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\": \"How can I reset my password?\"}"
```

### Expected Response
The API will return a JSON response with the predicted category of the query.

```json
{
  "category": "Password Reset"
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Enhance the NLP model with advanced techniques like BERT or GPT.
2. Develop a web or mobile interface for customer interaction.
3. Implement user session management and query processing.
4. Integrate a feedback mechanism to improve the models continuously.
5. Deploy the system using Docker and cloud services like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
